  <!-- PROFESSIONAL EXPLANATION -->
  <div class="bottom-info">
    <strong>Why does RizzLines ask for age?</strong><br><br>

    At RizzLines, personalization is essential to creating confident, comfortable, and
    respectful conversations. Age plays a major role in communication style, humor,
    references, and social boundaries. Asking for an age range allows RizzLines to suggest
    rizz lines and conversation starters that feel appropriate, relatable, and natural
    for your stage of life.

    <br><br>
    This information helps ensure that content matches maturity level and social context.
    What feels funny or charming at one age may feel awkward or out of place at another.
    By understanding general age ranges, RizzLines avoids generic suggestions and instead
    provides content that aligns better with real-world interactions.

    <br><br>
    Age selection is also important for maintaining a safe and responsible platform.
    Certain types of content are only appropriate for adults, while younger users benefit
    from lighter, respectful, and age-appropriate suggestions. Selecting an age range
    helps RizzLines maintain these boundaries without collecting sensitive personal data.

    <br><br>
    We want to be completely transparent: RizzLines does not require your exact age or
    date of birth. We only ask for a general age range, which reduces risk and protects
    your privacy. No names, emails, phone numbers, or identifying details are collected
    at this step.

    <br><br>
    Privacy is a core value at RizzLines. Your age range is stored locally on your device
    using browser storage. This information stays on your phone or computer and is not
    transmitted to advertisers, third-party services, or external databases. We do not
    sell data or track users across websites.

    <br><br>
    From a user-experience perspective, age-based personalization improves quality and
    relevance. Instead of repeating the same lines for everyone, RizzLines adapts tone,
    language, and style to better suit your age group. This leads to more natural
    conversations and greater confidence when interacting with others.

    <br><br>
    It is also important to clarify what RizzLines does not do. We do not monitor private
    messages, access personal chats, or use age selection for profiling or advertising.
    Age selection does not affect access to features unfairly — it exists solely to
    improve content relevance and platform safety.

    <br><br>
    By continuing, you acknowledge that this selection is optional, non-identifying, and
    used only to enhance your experience. RizzLines is built on transparency, respect,
    and responsible personalization — because confidence should always feel safe.
