  <!-- PROFESSIONAL EXPLANATION -->
  <div class="bottom-info">
    <strong>Why does RizzLines ask for gender?</strong><br><br>

    At RizzLines, our mission is to help users communicate more confidently, naturally,
    and effectively in social and romantic conversations. Communication styles, humor,
    and flirting preferences can vary depending on context and personal comfort. Asking
    for gender allows us to tailor rizz lines and conversation starters in a way that
    feels relevant rather than generic.

    <br><br>
    This selection is used strictly for personalization. Certain expressions, jokes,
    and conversation tones may work better in specific scenarios. By understanding the
    general context you prefer, RizzLines can suggest content that feels smoother,
    more natural, and less awkward — improving confidence and success in conversations.

    <br><br>
    We want to be completely transparent: RizzLines does not use this information to
    identify you personally. We do not request your name, email address, phone number,
    or any real-world identifying details at this stage. Your gender selection is simply
    a preference setting used to improve content relevance.

    <br><br>
    Privacy is a core principle of RizzLines. Your selection is stored locally on your
    device using browser storage. This means the information stays on your phone or
    computer and is not transmitted to external servers, advertisers, or third parties.
    We do not sell data, track identities, or build behavioral profiles.

    <br><br>
    Inclusivity is important to us. Communication and attraction are personal, and not
    everyone fits neatly into a single category. That is why RizzLines offers inclusive
    options and focuses on comfort and respect rather than assumptions.

    <br><br>
    From a user-experience perspective, personalization reduces repetition and improves
    quality. Instead of showing random or one-size-fits-all lines, RizzLines adapts its
    suggestions to your selected context. This leads to better engagement, more natural
    interactions, and increased confidence.

    <br><br>
    It is also important to clarify what we do not do. We do not monitor private messages,
    access conversations, or track activity outside the website. Gender selection does
    not affect access to features or visibility — it only influences the type of content
    displayed.

    <br><br>
    By continuing, you acknowledge that this selection is optional, non-identifying,
    and used solely to improve your experience. RizzLines is built on transparency,
    respect, and user trust — because confidence starts with feeling comfortable.
